# Autokey scritps

A series of scripts to make the use of the Motospeed ck62 keyboard easier.

## How to start using it

CAPSLOCK KEY - Don't forget to put it as a Hyper key, configuring other keys to work as the shift key

TERMINAL - Don't forget to configure the copy and paste commands as ctrl+c and ctrl+v instead of the ctrl+shift ones
